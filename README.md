# Graph_enhance_NL2LTL
  The method converts NL requirements to LTL by constructing a Concept–Predicate–Operator graph, running random-walk-with-restart to derive structured reasoning paths, feeding these paths and the NL to LLMs for candidate formulas, and validating syntax via a formal LTL parser.
