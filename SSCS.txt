If the engine control system is operational and detects an engine overheat, it should activate the cooling system.
If the ship is in cooling mode and the cabin temperature exceeds 22 degrees Celsius, the spacecraft thermal control system should switch to increase coolant flow mode.
If the surveillance system is in surveillance mode and detects an unidentified object, it should initiate a tracking sequence.
In cruise mode, the communication array will immediately check if the signal quality degrades significantly, and then realign the antenna towards the nearest relay satellite.
In data gathering mode, the science instruments will immediately check if the target celestial body is within sensor range, and then activate all relevant sensors and begin data collection.
In docking mode, the attitude control system will immediately check if the alignment is off by more than 5 degrees and then adjust the orientation to match the docking station.
In emergency abort mode, the flight control system will immediately check if a critical system failure is detected and then initiate the escape sequence and notify ground control.
In landing sequence mode, the descent thrusters will immediately check if the altitude is below 100 meters and then increase thrust to slow down the descent.
In maintenance mode, the robotic repair tools will immediately check if an anomaly in spacecraft hull integrity is detected, and then deploy repair bots to the affected area.
In power management mode, the energy distribution system will immediately check if solar panel efficiency drops below 75% and then reroute power from non-essential systems.
In the event of an emergency shutdown command, the reactor control must complete the reactor shutdown process within 10 seconds.
In thermal regulation mode, the cooling systems will immediately check if internal temperatures exceed operational thresholds, and then increase coolant flow and adjust external radiator panels.
Once the descent is initiated and the landing zone is verified clear, the landing system should activate the full landing sequence to safely bring the spacecraft to the surface.
Once the orbit correction signal starts, the navigation system must begin correcting the orbit within 30 seconds.
Should signal loss occur while data transmission is active, the communication system needs to initiate signal recovery procedures to restore communication as quickly as possible.
Should the abort launch command be signaled, the launch system must confirm the launch abort without delay.
Should the flight mode be active and an engine failure is detected, the flight control system needs to immediately transition to emergency landing mode.
The altitude hold system is required to maintain a minimum altitude of 1000 feet at all times.
The autopilot system is required to maintain altitude between 1000 and 40000 feet.
The cabin oxygen level must always be maintained at or above 21%.
The communication system must maintain signal strength at 70% or higher.

Upon initiating fuel transfer with all valves confirmed open, the fuel management system should proceed to transfer fuel, monitoring the flow to ensure no discrepancies.
Upon receiving the command to activate the solar panels, the power management system must deploy the solar panels within one minute.
Upon reception of the payload release command, the payload management system must deploy the payload without delay.
When a distress signal is received, the communication system must transmit a distress response within 2 minutes.
When emergency mode is activated and cabin pressure remains stable, the life support system must maintain safety mode to ensure the wellbeing of all onboard.
When navigation is active and a waypoint is reached, the navigation system must update to the next waypoint without delay.
When orbital decay is detected after achieving orbit, the orbital adjustment system must correct the orbit to ensure the spacecraft remains on its intended trajectory.
